## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension

### What I learned

- The logic of doing a modal with React and CSS. Basically, changing the class of the element; one class is hidden and the other not. Also using a semitransparent div to darken the screen behind the menu.
- Use of react-responsive to make media queries and to render some elements depending on the size of the screen. Elements like background image or buttons.
- SASS: Nesting, variables, mixins and folder structure.
- Common CSS: media queries, flexbox, selectors.

```html
{isDesktop ? (
<button className="{bookmarkedButtonClass}" onClick="{handleClick}">
  {bookmarkedButtonClass === "bookmark-button" ? (
  <img src="{iconBookmark}" alt="" />
  ) : (
  <img src="{iconBookmarkCyan}" alt="" />
  )}
  <span>Bookmark</span>
</button>
) : (
<button className="{bookmarkedButtonClass}" onClick="{handleClick}">
  {bookmarkedButtonClass === "bookmark-button" ? (
  <img src="{iconBookmark}" alt="" />
  ) : (
  <img src="{iconBookmarkCyan}" alt="" />
  )}
</button>
)}
```

```css
.menu-mobile {
  display: none;
  padding: 0;
  width: 90%;
  top: 5rem;
  position: fixed;
  background-color: white;
  opacity: 1;
  border-radius: 10px;
  z-index: 3;

  .menu-item {
    height: 5rem;
    flex: 1;
    @include flex-row;
    justify-content: start;

    a {
      margin: auto 2rem;
    }
  }

  .menu-item:first-child,
  .menu-item:nth-child(2) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid $medium-gray;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

- Implement smooth transitions with CSS when opening and closing modals
- Better components structure

### Useful resources

- [React-Responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive) - React-Responsive is a library that makes it easy to apply media queries.
- [Tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/how-to-build-a-responsive-navigation-bar-with-flexbox--cms-33535t) - This tutorial shows you very clear how to do a responsive navbar with vanilla JavaScript. After learn the logic, you have to change some things to make it work in React.
